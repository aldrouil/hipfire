//! One home for "where do this model's weights live", shared by every arch that

//! ([`LayerBytes`], built from its own tensor index and its own tensor-name

//! moves here is the *arithmetic* config used to own (`largest_fitting_tail`),
//! because placement arithmetic is not configuration vocabulary.
//!
//! Nothing here is a fixed host budget: `MemAvailable`, live GTT and TTM's page
//! pool are read at load time, and the intended failure mode is a load-time
//! refusal that prints numbers rather than an OOM later.
